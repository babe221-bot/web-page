## Feedback and Examples
- "Mujo, wanting to show off his new computer, tells Suljo: 'This thing is so smart, it knows everything!' Suljo, unimpressed, replies: 'Oh yeah? Does it know what I'm having for lunch today?' Mujo thinks for a moment, then types furiously. The computer prints out: 'Grilled trout with a side of blitva.' Suljo laughs, 'Wrong! I'm having beans!' Mujo grins, 'See? It even knows you're lying!'"
