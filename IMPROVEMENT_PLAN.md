# Improvement Plan

This document outlines the improvements made to the DaorsForge AI Systems website and future work that is planned.

## Completed Improvements

*   **Footer Links:** Fixed broken social media links and updated the domain and email address in the footer.
*   **Insights Component:** Created a dynamic `Insights` component that displays industry-specific information after a user submits the contact form.
*   **Accessibility:**
    *   Added ARIA attributes to the contact form.
    *   Implemented clear focus indicators for interactive elements.
    *   Improved the semantic HTML structure of the entire site.
*   **Style Guide Alignment:**
    *   Updated the color palette in `tailwind.config.ts` to match the style guide.
    *   Updated the fonts in `src/app/layout.tsx` to match the style guide.

## Future Work

*   **Icon Library:** The blueprint specifies "Font Awesome," but the project currently uses "lucide-react." This should be updated to "Font Awesome" to match the style guide.
*   **Domain and Email:** The domain and email address in the footer have been updated, but the new domain is not yet active. This should be monitored and the links should be tested once the new domain is live.
*   **Contact Form Submission:** The contact form currently logs the form data to the console. This should be updated to send the form data to a server or a third-party service.
*   **Logo Showcase:** The logo showcase currently uses placeholder images. These should be replaced with actual partner logos.
