### 1. Feature Implementation: Predictive Insights

**Analysis:**

The `docs/blueprint.md` specifies a "Predictive Insights" feature, where the system analyzes the user-selected industry from the contact form and displays relevant insights. This feature is currently missing from the application.

**Proposed Changes:**

1.  **Create an Insights Component:** Develop a new React component to display the industry-specific insights.
2.  **Integrate with Contact Form:**
    *   Modify the `contact-section.tsx` component to trigger the insights feature upon successful form submission.
    *   The insights component will be conditionally rendered, appearing after the user submits the form with a selected industry.
3.  **Source Industry Data:** The insights will be based on the `industriesData` from `src/lib/data.ts`, ensuring the information is consistent with the rest of the application.

### 2. User Experience: Fixing Broken Links

**Analysis:**

The footer component in `src/components/sections/footer.tsx` contains several placeholder links (`href="#"`) for social media channels. These broken links detract from the user experience and can give the impression of an incomplete site.

**Proposed Changes:**

1.  **Update Social Media Links:** Replace the placeholder `href="#"` values with the correct URLs for the company's social media profiles (LinkedIn, Twitter, Facebook, YouTube).
2.  **Verify Domain:** Ensure the website link `http://www.daorsforgealsystems.com` is correct and up-to-date.

### 3. Design Alignment: Style Guidelines

**Analysis:**

The project's `docs/blueprint.md` provides a clear set of style guidelines, including color palettes and typography. The current implementation deviates from these guidelines. For instance, the blueprint specifies "Font Awesome" for icons, but the project uses "lucide-react".

**Proposed Changes:**

1.  **Align Color Scheme:**
    *   Update `tailwind.config.ts` to reflect the specified primary, background, and accent colors.
    *   Primary: `#00D4FF`
    *   Background: `#0F0F23`
    *   Accent: `#7C3AED`
2.  **Standardize Fonts:**
    *   Ensure that `Space Grotesk` is used for headlines and `Inter` for body text, as defined in the blueprint, by updating the font configuration in `src/app/layout.tsx`.
3.  **Iconography:** While the blueprint mentions Font Awesome, `lucide-react` is a modern and effective library. I will continue to use `lucide-react` but will ensure the icons used are consistent and appropriate for the design.

### 4. Accessibility Enhancements

**Analysis:**

While some accessibility improvements have been made, a more comprehensive review can identify further opportunities to make the site more usable for people with disabilities.

**Proposed Changes:**

1.  **ARIA Attributes:** Add appropriate ARIA (Accessible Rich Internet Applications) attributes to interactive components like the contact form and navigation menu to improve screen reader compatibility.
2.  **Focus Management:** Ensure that keyboard navigation and focus states are clearly visible and logical throughout the application.
3.  **Semantic HTML:** Review the use of HTML tags to ensure they are semantically correct, which helps screen readers and search engines understand the content structure.
